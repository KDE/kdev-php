You want to start hacking on the PHP plugin for KDevelop?

No problem, go ahead! You might want to get in touch with
Niko Sams (nsams) and me, Milian Wolff (milian). Currently
we are the ones maintaining the plugin.

What you have to respect when you write patches:

- adhere to the kdelibs coding style,
  see the following about more information:
  http://techbase.kde.org/Policies/Kdelibs_Coding_Style
  
- try to write meaningful comments. Especially non-trivial parts
  must be commented to ease maintanance
